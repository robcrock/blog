I built this to stop second-guessing transform order. Drag the controls and watch the element respond. The behavior is the explanation.

## The Invisible Physics of Transform

CSS transforms are deceptively simple. Four properties: `translate`, `rotate`, `scale`, and `transform-origin`. Yet mastering them unlocks the foundation of every meaningful UI animation.

The playground above lets you _feel_ how these properties interact. But there's nuance worth understanding.

## Transform Order Matters

Transforms are applied right-to-left. This means:

```css
transform: translate(100px, 0) rotate(45deg) scale(1.5);
```

...is fundamentally different from:

```css
transform: scale(1.5) rotate(45deg) translate(100px, 0);
```

In the first, the element scales, then rotates, then moves. In the second, it moves first (by 100px), then rotates around its new position, then scales from there.

Play with the controls above and watch how the element behaves differently depending on which property you adjust first.

## Transform Origin: The Pivot Point

This is where things get interesting. The `transform-origin` property defines the point around which transformations occur. By default, it's `center`—but watch what happens when you change it to `top left`:

- **Rotation** now pivots from the corner, not the center
- **Scale** grows outward from that corner
- The element feels _anchored_ differently

This is why origin-aware animations feel more natural. When a dropdown appears, it should scale from its trigger—not from some abstract center point.

## The Spring Animation

Notice how the element doesn't just _snap_ to its new position? That's Framer Motion's spring physics at work:

```tsx
transition={{
  type: "spring",
  stiffness: 300,
  damping: 30,
}}
```

Springs create the feeling of physical mass. The element has _weight_. It overshoots slightly, then settles. This is what separates mechanical UI from interfaces that feel alive.

## Performance Note

All transforms here are GPU-accelerated. We're only animating `transform` and `opacity`—the two properties browsers can composite without triggering layout recalculations.

Never animate `top`, `left`, `width`, or `height` if you can avoid it. Transform can achieve the same visual result with a fraction of the performance cost.

_Try hovering over the element. The subtle scale bump on hover uses the same spring physics, creating a cohesive tactile response throughout the interaction._
