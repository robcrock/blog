## The Problem with Generic Animations

Most popover libraries animate with a fixed transform-origin of `center`. The element scales up from its midpoint, regardless of where it was triggered from.

This works. But it doesn't _feel_ right.

When you click a button in the top-left corner and a dropdown appears scaling from its center, there's a subtle cognitive disconnect. The UI element seems to materialize from nowhere—as if it teleported into existence.

## The Fix: Origin-Aware Animation

The solution is embarrassingly simple: match the `transform-origin` to the trigger's position relative to the popover.

```css
/* Popover triggered from top-left */
transform-origin: top left;

/* Popover triggered from bottom-right */
transform-origin: bottom right;
```

Now when the popover scales in, it appears to _grow_ from the button. The element has a source. It belongs.

## The Implementation

Toggle through the origin options in the playground above. Notice how each one changes where the popover "blooms" from.

Here's the pattern:

```tsx
<motion.div
  style={{
    transformOrigin: origin, // "top left", "center", etc.
  }}
  initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
  exit={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 }}
  transition={{
    type: "spring",
    stiffness: 400,
    damping: 30,
  }}
>
  {content}
</motion.div>
```

The key insight: `transformOrigin` must be set _before_ the animation runs. It's not animated itself—it's the anchor point for the scale transformation.

## Choosing the Right Origin

A simple heuristic:

| Trigger Position | Transform Origin |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Above popover    | `bottom center`  |
| Below popover    | `top center`     |
| Left of popover  | `right center`   |
| Right of popover | `left center`    |
| Top-left corner  | `bottom right`   |

In practice, you can calculate this dynamically by comparing the trigger's bounding rect to the popover's position.

## Why This Matters

This is exactly the kind of detail that's invisible when done right—and jarring when done wrong. Users won't consciously notice your origin-aware animations. But they'll _feel_ that your UI is more polished, more intentional, more "Apple-like."

The best interface details are the ones nobody talks about.

_Try clicking the button with different origins selected. Pay attention to where your eye is drawn during the animation. That's the origin point at work._
